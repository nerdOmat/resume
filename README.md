# Resume

Since I was bored of my old resume I designed a new one. One version I designed in HTML5 and CSS3. To make it as stable as possible I do not use any scripts. A further version I designed in SVG (using inkscape). This one has been converted to pdf.

## Colors

At the moment the red version is available only. However, different colors will be coming soon.

## Typography 

I am not an expert in these things, so I used Trebuchet MS font. It is popular and whitespread. Besides it is a good sans serif alternative to Arial.

## Pictograms

Thanks and all credits to Daniel Bruce for the beautiful pictograms. All of them (except countX.svg) have been taken from Daniels website — www.entypo.com.
